Meeting Agenda  Date: 14/4  Facilitator: Andrea  Secretary: Lisa  Participants: Maija, Rebecca, Lisa, Andrea1. ObjectivesWe need to get feedback on our domain model, prepare for the presentation on Monday, finish the UML so that we can start implementing the game.2. ReportsAs a group we have finished the RAD, finished our use cases, and made a first draft of the domain model and UML. We have also continued to experiment with tiled map and sprites.3. Discussion items? Items and Characters - It’s hard to make it exactly as reality.? What use cases should we implement first.? Move should be the first? We need a prototype world just for initial implementation.? Should start with simple terrain and then build more dense terrain.? Should start with simple individuals - and then build up to characters with specific content.4. Outcomes and assignments? Everyone: Prepare presentation, finish if any corrections to domain model. Continued work on the UML to establish individual work. Also soft start to implement individually until Monday.? Andrea: How to load a tile map and create/interpret the different functionalities dependent on density and object.? Lisa: Create the main player and the corresponding movement pattern.? Maija: Build a prototype world.? Rebecca: Initial build of the controller (specifically keyboard-listener).5. Wrap upCommunication is key! And we’ll discuss our thoughts and issues about our individual missions.Next meeting will be on Monday the 18/4 at 12.00.
