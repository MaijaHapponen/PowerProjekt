1. Objective
Problem with JUnit tests in gradle.

2. Reports 
Everyone: Different frameworks - we switched from maven and swing to gradle and libGDX. We are still using tiled to make the maps for the game. 
Maija: Have not looked into sprites, instead she has installed gradle and libGDX, handled all the problems! GRADLE EXPERT.
Andrea: Have made the map show on the screen. Have started looking into how camera works and implemented a “character”, not full sprite just an example.
Lisa: Have looked into tests. It worked before we switched to gradle. Made tests for player and position classes. Have trouble to make it work on gradle at the moment. 
Rebecca: Have started looking at it, started to connect it with the player class.
