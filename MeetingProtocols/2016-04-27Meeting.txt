  Date: 27/4
 Facilitator: Lisa

1. Objectives
 
* Collision, something wrong with object layer
* Map-reader class (model) instead of reading map in the view
* Movement, move while key pressed instead of one step at a time


2. Reports (15 min)


Everyone have tried their best to help each other with all the problems that have occured. 
 
Lisa: have created methods for drawing all the mascots and humen, should work just need to add list with positions


Rebecca: tried to fix the collision issue, but was not successful. Also looked into the movement issue.


Maija: tried to fix the movement, might have an idea that can work. Later looked into the collision issue without further progress.


Andrea: fixed the code to make the camera look at the player, and also tried to refactor the code according to MVC standards. 

3. Discussion items (35 min) 

* Sprites needs to be fixed to continue character development
* Always write branch name with small character, i.e “developMovement”
* Mostly things we need to go through 
* Use slack
