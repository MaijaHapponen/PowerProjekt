Meeting Agenda

  Date: 3/5
 Facilitator: Lisa
  Secretary: Maija
 Participants: Maija, Lisa, Rebecca (Andrea is absent)

1. Objectives (5 min).
* Nullpointers for Rebecca
* Collision is still not fixed
* We have issues with MVC, most parts of the project has been refactored however we are not sure if we have done it correctly


2. Reports (15 min) 
Maija & Rebecca: not done with collision or movement, have instead focused on MVC which might solve at least the movement problem’


Andrea & Lisa: Have looked into sprites (animation) but have not been able to fix character movement because collision does not work. Have also tried to refactor the code inte MVC standards.

3. Discussion items (35 min) 
* MVC structure in project may solve many problems
   * Movement issue - keyIsPressed can be used in PlayerController
   * Collison needs to be fixed
   * Maps might be fixed with new structure
* CharacterController for movement or to be in CharacterModel ?
* Dictionary for character name and sprite? 


4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 
Lisa: Fix character with texture name (string) as a variable. Player’s animation when movement is fixed.


Rebecca: Fix movement with the new structure. Also look into character movement when collision is fixed (if there is time).


Maija: Fix collision to MVC and develop it further to work


Andrea: Fix the camera so it works with world width and height (look at the new structure).

5. Wrap up
Unresolved: have we done MVC correctly?
