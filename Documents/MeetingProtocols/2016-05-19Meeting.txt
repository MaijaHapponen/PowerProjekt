Objectives-Where to create CharacterControllers and should every character have their own controller och should we have one controller controlling all characters.-GameController is too big.

ReportsEveryone: We have all looked on the SDD, but we are not done yet. Lisa: Animation for characters is kind of done, but we have not been able to test it yet. Same with walkAway.Andrea: EnterNewWorld works but needs some fixes with the exit positions. You can walk over the campus. Went through requirementsMaija: Interact kind of works. Some classes needs to change names.Rebecca: Created new worlds (Hubben and Salonen). Made the how-to-play page.3. Discussion items -How to do with the CharacterController. Try to make one CharacterContoller for all characters that contains a list of all characters.-Collision should be closer to the player so that it looks better.  Less whitespace.4.
