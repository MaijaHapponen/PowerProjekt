Overall: 
* Alternate flows’ numbers are different depending on which line is different, i.e. Alternate flow 2.1 is the first alternate flow from the second line in the normal flow and 2.1.1 will be the fist line in the alternate flow and 2.1.2 is the second line ect. 
CatchMascot
* Will the “last mascot flow” will be an alternative flow in CatchMascot or ProgressBar discussed? Will be in progressBar.
* The normal flow in CatchMascot will be the player answers wrong instead of right. 
* The first two lines in alternative flows will be removed and since the end of the flow is the only thing that is different.
EnterNewWorld
