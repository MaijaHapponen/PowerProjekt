Meeting Agenda

  Date: 2016-05-05
 Facilitator: Maija
  Secretary: Andrea
 Participants: Andrea, Maija, Rebecca (not Lisa)

1. Objectives
* Github has to many branches that are not merged to master, nor removed. Needs to be evaluated.
* Collision still doesn’t work as it should. Ineffective method right now.
* Camera doesn’t work, as it shows more than the map.
* MVC - we need to rethink the name world. Game will be the world for the “main” classes.


2. Reports 
Andrea: Paris! 
Lisa: Continued work on characters and the movement of the player.
Rebecca: Progress bar has started to take form.
Maija: Collision is changed to fit with MVC-pattern, but does not quite work yet.


3. Discussion items 
* Collision 
Currently the position of any tile is in the lower left corner, we need to fix this in some way (adding height and width, or using some kind of box-logic(box2D)).
Making it not slow is of most importance right now! (might work if implementing box).
* Camera
The world needs to have a size, as the player should be able to move only within this area. Also the camera should follow the player unless nearing the sides. Works sometimes?
* Github
Everyone needs to rebase their branches often, as to ensure less conflicts and branches that closes completely. Currently the master is not completely up to date.


4. Outcomes and assignments 
Everyone: Finish the class-model as well as continue the SDD. Push the latest code that works to master


Andrea: Fix the camera, so that it follows in the proper way. Start with interact with human and mascot.
Lisa: Animation of the player when moving.
Rebecca: Continue on the progress bar, as well as how the progress works.
Maija: Continued work on collision and looking into box-logic. Adding collision to change world.

5. Wrap up
Next meeting will be on the 9th of may, at lunch.
